# Basic SDL Map Editor Example Demo
# developed by Richard Marks <ccpsceo@gmail.com>

This example shows the bare minimum source that you need in order to load and
display a map that is created with the Basic SDL Map Editor. (BSME)

This example is for version 0.0.4 of the BSME.

Controls:

Q, ESC - Quits the demo
W,S,A,D and Arrow Keys - Scroll around the map

If the demo executable cannot find the example_demo.map and example_demo.png
files then it will not run, and will report the missing files to stderr.


If you have any questions regarding this code, please contact me.
