Don't delete this file.

Every 5 minutes the editor will auto save a file into this folder***


** only if the map is altered.

When you exit the editor without properly saving after making changes, an autosave will be placed here.

The files are named with a time and date stamp and wipmap.sav

you can copy the file to wip.map and load it back into the editor


lets say that you made a mistake, and you've got your autosave backups (obviously more than 5 minutes had to have passed)

then on linux you can do this:

$ cp ./nameofthebackupfile.sav ../wip.map

to overwrite the current wip.map with the backup data and just reload in the editor and you're back in business!

There is no undo, so by keeping your autosaves you can keep a development progress journal.
