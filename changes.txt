# Basic SDL Map Editor
# developed by Richard Marks <ccpsceo@gmail.com>

The changes from v0.0.4 to v0.0.5 are as follows:

* the camera will pan when you move the mouse to any of the four edges surrounding the view and hold CTRL
* The S and L keys will save and load the map respectively
* the wsad and arrow key pan controls were removed as deemed unnecesary
* the ( and ) key controls were removed since the mouse-wheel will serve the same purpose.
* every 5 minutes the map will be automatically saved to a XXX_wipmap.sav where XXX is a special timestamp format
* when you exit the editor, the map will be saved.
* when the editor starts it will create a new blank wip.map file if it cannot find one to load.
* auto saving is only enabled when you alter the map. that way you aren't autosaving an unchanged map.
* fixed bug in tile selector that caused you to accidentally alter the map when closing the selector with right-clicking.
